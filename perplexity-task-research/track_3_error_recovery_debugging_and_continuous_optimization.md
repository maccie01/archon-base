## **Track 3: Error Recovery, Debugging & Continuous Optimization**

**Objective:** Establish *resilient recovery, debugging, and performance improvement systems* for large-scale multi-agent environments.

### Core Topics

*   **Failure Detection & Recovery:**

    *   Common agent failure types (tool misuse, infinite loops, hallucination cascades, injection vulnerabilities)
    *   Stateful recovery via preserved context and rollback checkpoints (COMMIT/BRANCH states)
    *   Retry logic with exponential backoff and fallback escalation (auto → simplified → human)
*   **Debugging Non-Deterministic Behavior:**

    *   Reasoning trace analysis and decision-path mapping instead of stack traces
    *   Contextual root cause tracing and adaptive error correction
*   **Monitoring & Observability:**

    *   Fine-grained reasoning logs and decision traces
    *   Performance metrics (success rate, time, resource use, error frequency)
    *   Real-time dashboards for concurrent agent tracking
*   **Continuous Learning & Optimization:**

    *   Feedback loops for model adaptation and improved failure recovery
    *   Cost and resource monitoring (token usage, API cost)

### Deliverables

*   Comprehensive agent error taxonomy
*   Recovery & fallback protocol templates
*   Debugging frameworks for reasoning analysis
*   Observability architecture and monitoring dashboards
*   Continuous optimization feedback systems
