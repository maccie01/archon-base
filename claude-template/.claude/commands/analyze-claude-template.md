You are analyzing a CLAUDE.md file to ensure it follows best practices for AI-assisted development with Archon integration.

## Task

Perform a comprehensive analysis of a CLAUDE.md file using the `claude-template-analyzer` agent.

## Steps

1. **Locate the CLAUDE.md file**
   - Check current directory
   - Or use path provided by user
   - Read the entire file

2. **Invoke the analyzer agent**
   - Use Task tool with `general-purpose` agent
   - Load the claude-template-analyzer agent instructions
   - Provide the CLAUDE.md content for analysis

3. **Generate analysis report**
   - Executive summary with ratings
   - Section-by-section breakdown
   - Critical gaps identification
   - Redundancies list
   - Prioritized improvements
   - Exemplar sections for weak areas

4. **Save the report**
   - Create `claude-template-analysis.md` in same directory
   - Include timestamp and file analyzed
   - Format for readability

## Agent Instructions

When invoking the analysis agent, provide these instructions:

```
Analyze the following CLAUDE.md file for quality, completeness, and best practices.

Use the claude-template-analyzer methodology to evaluate:
1. Core requirements (Archon-first rule, MCP tools, task workflow, RAG patterns)
2. Pattern quality (concrete examples, clear structure, actionable content)
3. Archon integration (tool coverage, workflows, quality gates)
4. AI optimization (clarity, completeness, priority, examples)
5. Gap identification (missing elements, weak sections)

[Insert CLAUDE.md content here]

Provide a detailed analysis report with:
- Executive summary (rating 1-10, top 3 strengths, top 3 gaps)
- Section-by-section analysis
- Critical gaps list
- Redundancies to remove
- Prioritized improvements (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- Exemplar sections for weak areas
```

## Output Format

Save analysis as `claude-template-analysis.md` with:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Template Analysis Report

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Analyze CLAUDE.md in current directory
/analyze-claude-template

# Analyze specific file
/analyze-claude-template path/to/CLAUDE.md

# Analyze and auto-apply critical fixes
/analyze-claude-template --fix-critical
```

## Success Criteria

Analysis is successful when:
- [ ] Report generated with all sections
- [ ] Overall rating provided (1-10)
- [ ] All critical gaps identified
- [ ] Concrete improvement recommendations
- [ ] Exemplar sections for weak areas
- [ ] Report saved to file

## Notes

- This analysis focuses on AI coding assistant effectiveness
- Archon integration is mandatory for all projects
- Templates should work immediately with minimal customization
- Every section must have concrete, actionable examples
