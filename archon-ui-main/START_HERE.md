# START HERE - Authentication Fix Deployment

Created: 2025-10-15 | Timestamp: 11:30:00

## Status: READY TO DEPLOY

The authentication issue has been diagnosed, fixed, and is ready for deployment.

## What's the Problem?

https://archon.nexorithm.io does not redirect to /login when users visit without authentication. Instead, it shows pages with 401 errors.

## What's the Fix?

Deploy the production build that includes authentication code. The build is ready at:
```
/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main/dist/
```

## How to Deploy (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main
./deploy-auth-fix.sh
```

Then verify: https://archon.nexorithm.io (should redirect to /login)

## Production Build Status

```
Status: Built successfully
Date: 2025-10-15
Time: 14.54s
Size: 1,394.89 kB (383.01 kB gzipped)
Location: /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main/dist/
Auth Code: Verified included in bundle
```

## Test API Key

```

```

## Quick Verification After Deploy

1. Open: https://archon.nexorithm.io
2. Should redirect to: /login
3. Enter API key above
4. Should see: Knowledge base loads successfully
5. Console: No 401 errors

## What Happens After Deploy?

### User Experience
- Unauthenticated users → Redirected to /login
- Login page displays API key input
- After valid key → Redirected to /knowledge
- All protected routes work
- Logout redirects back to /login

### Technical
- Production build served (not dev server)
- AuthContext enforces authentication
- ProtectedRoute wraps all routes
- API calls include Authorization header
- 401 responses trigger redirect to /login

## Issue Timeline

```
10:58 - Issue identified via browser testing
11:00 - Auth code verified in source
11:00 - Production build completed
11:05 - Deployment scripts created
11:30 - Documentation complete
??:?? - Awaiting deployment
```

## Next Steps

1. Run deployment script (30 seconds)
2. Verify at https://archon.nexorithm.io
3. Run test checklist (optional but recommended)
4. Notify Netzwächter client

## Decision Tree

```
Do you want to deploy immediately?
├─ YES → Run ./deploy-auth-fix.sh
└─ NO
   └─ Do you want to understand the issue first?
      ├─ YES → Read DIAGNOSIS_SUMMARY.md
      └─ NO
         └─ Do you want to see all options?
            ├─ YES → Read README_AUTH_FIX.md
            └─ NO → Read DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
```

## Summary

The authentication system is fully implemented in code but was never deployed to production. The production server is running a development build that doesn't properly serve the authentication components.

**The fix is simple**: Deploy the production build and restart the container.

**Deployment command**:
```bash
./deploy-auth-fix.sh
```

That's it. Everything else is documentation to help you understand what's happening.
