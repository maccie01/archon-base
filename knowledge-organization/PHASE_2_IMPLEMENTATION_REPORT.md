# Phase 2 Implementation Report: Backend Services

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Backend Services
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented all three new backend services and updated the existing KnowledgeItemService to support the two-layer knowledge organization system. All services follow established patterns from the Archon codebase, use Python 3.12 type hints, include comprehensive docstrings, and implement proper error handling with detailed logging.

## Services Created

### 1. KnowledgeFolderService
**Location**: `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/python/src/server/services/knowledge/knowledge_folder_service.py`
**Lines**: 359

#### Methods Implemented
- `create_folder()` - Creates folders with validation and configurable colors/icons
- `update_folder()` - Updates folder metadata with field validation
- `delete_folder()` - Safely deletes folders (sets source.folder_id to NULL via ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `get_folder()` - Retrieves single folder by ID
- `list_project_folders()` - Lists all folders for a project with source counts
- `get_folder_source_count()` - Efficiently counts sources in a folder

#### Key Design Decisions
- Automatic source unlinking on folder deletion preserves knowledge sources
- Batch source counting for performance in list operations
- Folders ordered by sort_order then created_at for flexible organization
- Color and icon support for visual differentiation in UI
- Comprehensive validation of required fields (project_id, folder_name)
- Strip whitespace from folder names to prevent empty names

#### Example Usage
```python
folder_service = KnowledgeFolderService(supabase_client)

# Create folder
folder = await folder_service.create_folder(
    project_id="proj_123",
    folder_name="Authentication",
    description="Auth system documentation",
    color_hex="#6366f1",
    icon_name="lock"
)

# List folders with source counts
folders = await folder_service.list_project_folders("proj_123")
# Returns: [{"id": "...", "folder_name": "Authentication", "source_count": 3}, ...]
```

### 2. KnowledgeTagService
**Location**: `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/python/src/server/services/knowledge/knowledge_tag_service.py`
**Lines**: 256

#### Methods Implemented
- `get_all_tags()` - Retrieves all tags with optional category filtering
- `get_tag_by_name()` - Looks up specific tag (case-insensitive)
- `get_tags_by_category()` - Returns tags organized by category for UI display
- `increment_tag_usage()` - Tracks tag application to sources
- `decrement_tag_usage()` - Decrements on tag removal (minimum 0)

#### Key Design Decisions
- Tag name normalization ensures case-insensitive lookup consistency
- Usage counting enables popularity-based sorting and analytics
- Category grouping supports organized tag selection in UI
- Non-raising get operations return None for graceful handling
- Tags ordered by usage_count (descending) then tag_name
- Usage count never goes below 0

#### Example Usage
```python
tag_service = KnowledgeTagService(supabase_client)

# Get all framework tags
framework_tags = await tag_service.get_all_tags(category="framework")

# Get tags by category for UI
tags_by_cat = await tag_service.get_tags_by_category()
# Returns: {"framework": ["react", "nextjs"], "language": ["python", "typescript"]}

# Track tag usage
await tag_service.increment_tag_usage("react")  # Usage count: 15 → 16
```

### 3. AutoTaggingService
**Location**: `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/python/src/server/services/knowledge/auto_tagging_service.py`
**Lines**: 245

#### Methods Implemented
- `suggest_tags()` - Analyzes URL and content for tag suggestions
- `add_url_pattern()` - Runtime extension of URL patterns
- `add_content_keyword()` - Runtime extension of content keywords

#### Predefined Patterns
**URL Patterns** (20+ patterns):
- `react.dev` → `["react", "javascript"]`
- `fastapi.tiangolo.com` → `["fastapi", "python"]`
- `docs.docker.com` → `["docker", "deployment"]`
- `stripe.com` → `["payment", "api"]`

**Content Keywords** (15+ patterns):
- "authentication" → `["authentication", "security"]`
- "api reference" → `["api-reference", "documentation"]`
- "testing" → `["testing"]`
- "microservices" → `["microservices", "architecture"]`

#### Key Design Decisions
- Pattern-based approach allows easy extension without ML complexity
- Combines URL and content analysis for comprehensive suggestions
- Returns suggestions only (no automatic application per approved decisions)
- Deduplication and ordering ensure clean tag lists
- Graceful error handling returns empty list rather than failing
- Case-insensitive matching for robustness
- Runtime extensibility for custom patterns

#### Example Usage
```python
auto_tag_service = AutoTaggingService()

# Suggest tags for React documentation
tags = await auto_tag_service.suggest_tags(
    url="https://react.dev/reference/react",
    title="React Reference",
    summary="Complete API reference for React hooks and components"
)
# Returns: ["react", "javascript", "api-reference", "documentation"]

# Add custom pattern at runtime
auto_tag_service.add_url_pattern(r"mycompany\.com", ["internal", "company"])
```

### 4. KnowledgeItemService Updates
**Location**: `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/python/src/server/services/knowledge/knowledge_item_service.py`

#### Changes Made
Enhanced `list_items()` method with scope filtering:

**New Parameters**:
- `project_id: str | None = None` - Filter by project ID (used with scope="project")
- `scope: str = "all"` - Knowledge scope filter with three modes:
  - `"all"` - Returns all knowledge (default, no scope filter)
  - `"global"` - Returns only global knowledge sources
  - `"project"` - Returns project-specific knowledge (uses project_id)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Apply scope filter
if scope == "global":
    query = query.eq("knowledge_scope", "global")
elif scope == "project":
    query = query.eq("knowledge_scope", "project")
    if project_id:
        query = query.eq("project_id", project_id)
```

#### Key Design Decisions
- Applied scope filters to both main query and count query for accuracy
- Maintains backward compatibility (scope defaults to "all")
- Works seamlessly with existing filters (knowledge_type, search)
- Database-level filtering for optimal performance

#### Example Usage
```python
item_service = KnowledgeItemService(supabase_client)

# Get global knowledge only
global_items = await item_service.list_items(scope="global")

# Get project-specific knowledge
project_items = await item_service.list_items(
    scope="project",
    project_id="proj_123"
)

# Search within project knowledge
search_results = await item_service.list_items(
    scope="project",
    project_id="proj_123",
    search="authentication"
)
```

## Integration Points

### Database Tables
All services integrate with Phase 1 database schema:
- `archon_project_knowledge_folders` - Folder management
- `archon_knowledge_tags` - Tag definitions
- `archon_sources` - Enhanced with `knowledge_scope`, `project_id`, `folder_id` columns

### Service Layer Pattern
All services follow established Archon patterns:
- Constructor accepts `supabase_client` parameter
- Async/await for all database operations
- Return typed dicts (not ORM objects)
- Comprehensive logging via `get_logger(__name__)`
- Try/except blocks with appropriate error handling
- Docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises sections
- Type hints using Python 3.12 syntax (`str | None`)

### Logging Strategy
Consistent logging approach across all services:
- **Info level**: Operation start/success with key identifiers
- **Warning level**: Non-critical failures (missing tags, etc.)
- **Error level**: Exceptions with full context
- **Debug level**: Pattern matches, intermediate steps

Example log output:
```
INFO  Creating knowledge folder | project_id=proj_123 | folder_name=Authentication
INFO  Knowledge folder created successfully | folder_id=folder_abc
INFO  Suggesting tags | url=https://react.dev
DEBUG URL pattern matched | pattern=react\.dev | tags=["react", "javascript"]
INFO  Tags suggested | url=https://react.dev | tag_count=2 | tags=["react", "javascript"]
```

---

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
All services use Python 3.12 type hints:
```python
async def create_folder(
    self,
    project_id: str,
    folder_name: str,
    description: str | None = None,
    color_hex: str = "#6366f1",
    icon_name: str = "folder",
) -> dict[str, Any]:
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive try/except blocks with context:
```python
try:
    # Database operation
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to create folder | error={str(e)} | project_id={project_id}")
    raise
```

### Documentation
All public methods include docstrings:
```python
"""
Create a new knowledge folder for a project.

Args:
    project_id: UUID of the project
    folder_name: Name of the folder
    description: Optional description of folder contents
    color_hex: Hex color for visual identification (default: indigo)
    icon_name: Icon identifier for UI display (default: folder)

Returns:
    Dict containing the created folder data

Raises:
    Exception: If folder creation fails
"""
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 3 - MCP Tool Updates
1. Update `rag_get_available_sources` to use scope filtering
2. Update `rag_search_knowledge_base` with scope parameter
3. Create new convenience tools:
   - `rag_search_project_knowledge(query, project_id, folder_name)`
   - `rag_search_global_knowledge(query, tags)`
   - `rag_list_project_folders(project_id)`

### Phase 4 - API Routes
**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/knowledge/global` - List global knowledge sources
- `GET /api/knowledge/projects/:projectId` - List project knowledge with folders
- `GET /api/knowledge/tags` - Get all tags with categories
- `POST /api/knowledge/folders` - Create folder
- `PUT /api/knowledge/folders/:folderId` - Update folder
- `DELETE /api/knowledge/folders/:folderId` - Delete folder
- `POST /api/knowledge/suggest-tags` - Get tag suggestions

**Updated Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/knowledge-items/crawl` - Add scope, project_id, folder_id
- `POST /api/documents/upload` - Add scope, project_id, folder_id
