## **Track 4: Knowledge, Memory & Context Management Systems**

**Objective:** Define how *agents maintain, retrieve, and evolve shared context and knowledge* across long-horizon projects.

### Core Topics

*   **Context Architecture & Memory Models:**

    *   Structured repositories (main.md, log.md, commit.md, metadata.yaml) for project history
    *   Context retrieval commands (CONTEXT, BRANCH, COMMIT, MERGE) with granularity controls
    *   BM25-like ranking or vector retrieval for context accuracy improvement
*   **Secrets & Secure Data Handling:**

    *   Use of environment variables, vault systems, or CLI authentication for agent access isolation
*   **Research & Information Gathering Patterns:**

    *   Coordinated multi-agent research teams running parallel investigations
    *   Iterative synthesis (hypothesis → review → refinement)
    *   Validation of gathered data for factual correctness and tool integrity
*   **Research-to-Roadmap Conversion:**

    *   Translating findings into actionable task roadmaps with dependencies and milestones
    *   Effort estimation and roadmap evolution as new outcomes appear

### Deliverables

*   Context management and repository structure templates
*   Command reference for COMMIT/BRANCH/CONTEXT operations
*   Research workflow and validation frameworks
*   Todo generation templates with dependency mapping
*   Secrets management and access control specifications
