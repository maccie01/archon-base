## Workflow

### Starting a Task

1. Update status to "In Progress"
2. Add assigned agent name
3. Add start date
4. Create corresponding answer file in `answers/` directory

### Completing a Task

1. Verify all success criteria met
2. Review code examples (test them!)
3. Integrate into knowledge base
4. Update status to "Completed"
5. Add completion date
6. Update progress percentages above

## Notes

- **Parallel Execution**: Security tasks (#1-14) can be executed by multiple agents simultaneously
- **Code Testing**: All code examples MUST be tested before marking task complete
- **Format Consistency**: All outputs must follow the existing knowledge base format
- **Integration**: Don't forget to update cross-references in related documents
- **Archon Upload**: After completing P0 tasks, upload updated knowledge base to Archon for testing

## Next Actions

1. Create remaining research prompts for tasks #4-26
2. Assign tasks to available task agents
3. Begin execution with P0 security tasks
4. Review completed tasks daily
5. Update this tracker after each task completion
