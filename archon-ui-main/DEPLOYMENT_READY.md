# Deployment Ready - Action Required

## Status: READY TO DEPLOY

The authentication fix is built and ready. You need to deploy it to the server.

## What I've Done

1. ✓ Identified the issue: Production running Vite dev server, not production build
2. ✓ Verified auth code exists in source (AuthContext, ProtectedRoute, LoginPage)
3. ✓ Built production bundle with all auth code included
4. ✓ Created deployment scripts and documentation

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Deploy (Choose One Method)

**Method A - Automated Script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main
./deploy-auth-fix.sh
```

**Method B - Manual Commands**
```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main

# Sync files
rsync -avz --delete dist/ root@91.98.156.158:/opt/archon/archon-ui-main/dist/

# Restart container
ssh root@91.98.156.158 "cd /opt/archon/archon-ui-main && docker compose restart archon-ui"
```

### Step 2: Verify It Works

1. Open browser to: https://archon.nexorithm.io
2. Should redirect to /login (this is the fix!)
3. Login with API key: `ak_597A_U6Z6POYpv8Sae-LxSNj2qe5dFXE6qzBjXe0tikQHqkI`
4. Should see Knowledge Base loading successfully
5. Check browser console - should be clean (no 401 errors)
6. Test logout - should redirect back to /login

### Step 3: Run Full Verification

Use the checklist in `AUTH_FIX_REPORT.md` section "Verification Checklist"

## Documentation Created

1. **QUICK_DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - 2-minute deploy guide
2. **DEPLOY_AUTH_FIX.md** - Detailed deployment options
3. **AUTH_FIX_REPORT.md** - Complete analysis and technical details
4. **deploy-auth-fix.sh** - Automated deployment script
5. **DEPLOYMENT_READY.md** - This file

## The Issue in Plain English

The production site was running the development server, which doesn't properly serve the authentication code. I've built the production version that includes all the auth features. Now you just need to copy these built files to the server and restart the container.

## Expected Outcome

After deployment:
- Users will be redirected to /login when not authenticated
- Login page will work properly
- All protected routes will require authentication
- Netzwächter knowledge base data will be secure
- Clean user experience with no confusing 401 errors

## If You Encounter Issues

1. Check container logs: `ssh root@91.98.156.158 "docker compose -f /opt/archon/archon-ui-main/docker-compose.yml logs archon-ui"`
2. Verify files copied: `ssh root@91.98.156.158 "ls -la /opt/archon/archon-ui-main/dist/"`
3. Check if container is running: `ssh root@91.98.156.158 "docker ps | grep archon-ui"`
