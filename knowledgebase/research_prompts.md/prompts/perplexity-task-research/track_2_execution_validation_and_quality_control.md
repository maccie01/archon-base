## **Track 2: Execution, Validation & Quality Control**

**Objective:** Develop frameworks for *verifiable, self-auditing agent task execution* and high-confidence completion criteria.

### Core Topics

*   **Task Completion Criteria:** Schema-based verification, measurable success conditions, test-driven completion gates, peer review loops, and human-in-the-loop validation.
*   **Testing & Quality Assurance:**

    *   Sandbox and staged deployments for safe validation
    *   Automated regression and schema validation tests
    *   Failure simulation (timeouts, rate limits, bad outputs)
    *   Continuous QA through multi-layered review checkpoints
*   **Workflow Patterns for Production:**

    *   Reliable structures such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, evaluator-optimizer, and full-autonomy workflows
    *   Pattern selection trade-offs (predictability vs. flexibility, complexity vs. cost)
    *   Maintainability and cost-efficiency design principles

### Deliverables

*   Completion criteria and validation checkpoint templates
*   Test suite and QA frameworks for agent workflows
*   Pattern catalog with use-case mappings and anti-patterns
*   Deployment quality gates and regression monitoring templates
