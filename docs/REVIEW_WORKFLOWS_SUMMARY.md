**Purpose**: Pragmatic code quality review before commits/PRs

**Features**:
- 7-level hierarchical review framework:
  1. Architectural Design & Integrity (Critical)
  2. Functionality & Correctness (Critical)
  3. Security (Non-Negotiable)
  4. Maintainability & Readability (High Priority)
  5. Testing Strategy (High Priority)
  6. Performance & Scalability (Important)
  7. Dependencies & Documentation (Important)

- Severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Nitpick
- Confidence threshold: Only report issues with >80% confidence
- Integrates with Archon knowledge base for project standards
- Optional task creation for findings

**When to use**:
- After implementing any feature
- Before creating pull requests
- When refactoring existing code
- For all code changes to main branch

### 2. Security Review (`/security-review`)

**Features**:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories:
  1. Input Validation (SQL injection, Command injection, Path traversal, XXE)
  2. Authentication & Authorization (bypass, privilege escalation, session flaws)
  3. Cryptography & Secrets (hardcoded credentials, weak crypto)
  4. Injection & Code Execution (RCE, deserialization, XSS)
  5. Data Exposure (sensitive logging, IDOR, API leakage)

- Confidence scoring: 0.7-1.0 (only report >0.8)
- Concrete exploit scenarios with attack vectors
- Specific remediation code
- Hard exclusions: DoS, rate limiting, test-only issues, log spoofing, etc.
- Optional security task creation with high priority

**When to use**:
- When handling user input or authentication
- For API endpoints and data handling
- When working with sensitive data
- Before production deployments

### 3. Design Review (`/design-review`)

**Purpose**: UI/UX quality review with accessibility and responsive design validation

**Features**:
- 7-phase review process:
  1. Interaction & User Flow
  2. Responsiveness (desktop 1440px, tablet 768px, mobile 375px)
  3. Visual Polish (spacing, typography, colors)
  4. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
  5. Robustness (empty states, loading, errors)
  6. Code Health (component reuse, design tokens)
  7. Content & Console (clear labels, no errors)

- Severity levels: Blocker, High, Medium, Nitpick
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks (contrast, keyboard nav, focus states, alt text, etc.)
- Manual testing checklist provided
- Design system consistency validation
- Optional design task creation

**When to use**:
- After implementing UI components
- Before finalizing user-facing features
- For accessibility compliance checks
- When updating styles or layouts

## Integration with Archon

All three review workflows integrate seamlessly with Archon MCP:

### 1. Knowledge Base Integration

Each workflow searches Archon knowledge base for project-specific context:

**Code Review**:
- Searches for coding standards
- Finds security guidelines
- Retrieves similar code patterns

**Security Review**:
- Searches for security policies
- Finds authentication patterns
- Retrieves known vulnerability documentation

**Design Review**:
- Searches for design system documentation
- Finds UI component patterns
- Retrieves accessibility standards

### 2. Task Creation

All workflows can automatically create Archon tasks for findings:

**Example**:
```bash
# After review completes, Claude Code asks:
"Would you like me to create Archon tasks for the critical/high-priority findings?"

# If yes, tasks are created with:
- Proper severity tagging
- Detailed descriptions
- Remediation recommendations
- Links to relevant code
```

### 3. Specialized Agents

Each workflow uses the Task tool to invoke specialized subagents:
- `code-reviewer` - For structured code quality analysis
- `security-auditor` - For vulnerability scanning with exploit scenarios
- `design-reviewer` - For UI/UX and accessibility validation

---

## Usage Examples

### Quick Quality Check Before PR

```bash
# Run all three reviews in sequence
/review-code
/security-review
/design-review

# Or run specific review based on change type:
/review-code         # For backend/logic changes
/security-review     # For authentication/data handling
/design-review       # For UI components
```

### Full Development Cycle with QA

```bash
# 1. Plan the feature
/create-plan requirements/new-dashboard.md
# → Generates PRPs/new-dashboard.md with tasks

# 2. Implement the feature
/execute-plan PRPs/new-dashboard.md
# → Creates project, implements tasks, validates with tests

# 3. Review code quality
/review-code
# → Identifies issues across 7 quality dimensions

# 4. Fix any issues found, then run security audit
/security-review
# → Scans for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

# 5. For frontend features, run design review
/design-review
# → Validates UI/UX, accessibility, responsiveness

# 6. Commit and create PR with confidence!
git add .
git commit -m "Add new dashboard with full quality checks"
```

## What's NOT Yet Implemented

### Backend PydanticAI Agents

The following are documented but NOT yet implemented:

1. **Code Review Backend Agent** - Needs implementation in `python/src/agents/features/code_review/`
2. **Security Review Backend Agent** - Needs implementation in `python/src/agents/features/security_review/`
3. **Design Review Backend Agent** - Needs implementation in `python/src/agents/features/design_review/`

**Note**: The Claude Code subagents (code-reviewer.md, security-auditor.md, design-reviewer.md) work NOW via the Task tool. Backend agents are for future Archon UI/API integration.

### MCP Tools

The following MCP tools are documented but NOT yet exposed:

1. `archon:review_code` - Would wrap backend code review agent
2. `archon:security_review` - Would wrap backend security agent
3. `archon:design_review` - Would wrap backend design agent

**Note**: Current workflows work perfectly with Claude Code subagents. MCP tools are for future direct integration.

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

### Phase 1: Backend Agent Implementation (Optional)

If you want UI/API access to review workflows:
1. Implement PydanticAI agents in `python/src/agents/features/`
2. Create API endpoints in `python/src/server/api_routes/`
3. Add UI components in `archon-ui-main/src/features/`

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 weeks (per implementation plan)

### Phase 2: MCP Tool Exposure (Optional)

If you want direct MCP access (without subagents):
1. Implement MCP tool wrappers in `python/src/mcp_server/features/`
2. Register tools in MCP server
3. Update MCP instructions

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Optional)

- Historical review tracking and comparison
- Automated PR comments with review findings
- CI/CD integration for automated reviews
- Custom review templates per project
