# Frontend Authentication Fix Report

Created: 2025-10-15 | Timestamp: 11:00:00

## Executive Summary

The frontend authentication system was not working in production because the production deployment was serving the Vite development server instead of the production build. The authentication code (AuthContext, ProtectedRoute, LoginPage) exists in the source code but was never built and deployed to production.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Discovered
- URL: https://archon.nexorithm.io
- Expected: Redirect to /login for unauthenticated users
- Actual: Showing Knowledge Base page with 401 errors

### Investigation Findings

1. **Production Running Dev Server**
   - Console shows Vite dev server messages
   - WebSocket connection attempts to localhost:3737
   - Source maps exposed in browser

2. **Auth Code Missing from Deployed Bundle**
   - Browser evaluation showed: `hasAuthContext: false`
   - Browser evaluation showed: `hasProtectedRoute: false`
   - Browser evaluation showed: `hasLoginPage: false`

3. **API Calls Failing**
   - Multiple 401 errors in console
   - No redirect to /login triggered
   - API calls missing Authorization headers

4. **Local Source Code Correct**
   - AuthContext exists: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - LoginPage exists: `/src/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`
   - ProtectedRoute exists: `/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - App.tsx correctly configured with:
     - AuthProvider wrapping app (line 145)
     - ProtectedRoute on all routes (lines 37-54)
     - /login as public route (line 34)
     - ApiClientConfigurator redirecting on 401 (lines 64-66)

## Browser Testing Evidence

### Current Production State
- **URL accessed**: https://archon.nexorithm.io
- **Actual behavior**: Loaded /knowledge without redirect
- **Console errors**:
  - Failed to load resource: 401 on /api/knowledge-items/summary
  - Failed to load resource: 401 on /api/credentials/*
  - Failed to load resource: 401 on /api/projects
  - Vite dev server connection errors

### localStorage Contents
```javascript
{
  "archon_api_key": "<some old key>",
  "theme": "...",
  "archon_provider_models": "..."
}
```
Note: Old API key present but no auth logic to use it.

### Page State
- Navigation visible with Logout button
- Knowledge Base page rendered
- "Loading knowledge base..." message shown
- Alert displayed: "Failed to Load Knowledge Base - Authentication required"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Built Production Bundle
```bash
npm run build
# Output:
# ✓ 2882 modules transformed
# dist/index.html                   0.48 kB
# dist/assets/index-CocmMEva.css  365.13 kB
# dist/assets/index-CEqaV4H9.js  1,394.89 kB
# ✓ built in 14.54s
```

### 2. Verified Auth Code in Bundle
The production bundle at `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/archon-ui-main/dist/` now contains:
- Authentication provider logic
- Login page component
- Protected route wrapper
- API client with 401 redirect handling
- /login route registration

### 3. Deployment Options Provided

Three deployment methods documented in `DEPLOY_AUTH_FIX.md`:
1. Manual SCP + restart
2. Full rebuild on server
3. Rsync (recommended)

A deployment script created: `deploy-auth-fix.sh`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Authentication Flow
1. **Unauthenticated User**
   - Visit https://archon.nexorithm.io
   - Immediately redirected to /login
   - Login page displays with API key input field

2. **Login Process**
   - User enters API key
   - Frontend validates with `/api/auth/validate`
   - If valid: Store in localStorage, redirect to /knowledge
   - If invalid: Show error message

3. **Authenticated User**
   - All API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` header
   - Can access all protected routes
   - No 401 errors on valid requests

4. **Session Expiry**
   - If 401 received: Automatically redirect to /login
   - User must re-authenticate

5. **Logout**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Redirect to /login

## Security Improvements

### Before Fix (Broken State)
- No authentication enforcement
- All pages accessible without auth
- API calls attempted without Authorization header
- 401 errors logged but ignored
- Knowledge base data exposed in UI (even if API blocked it)

### After Fix (Secure State)
- Authentication required for all routes except /login
- API key stored securely in localStorage
- Authorization header on all API requests
- Automatic redirect to /login on 401
- Clean separation of public vs protected routes

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, test the following:

- [ ] Navigate to https://archon.nexorithm.io → redirects to /login
- [ ] Login page displays correctly
- [ ] Enter invalid API key → shows error
- [ ] Enter valid API key `ak_597A_U6Z6POYpv8Sae-LxSNj2qe5dFXE6qzBjXe0tikQHqkI` → succeeds
- [ ] After login → redirected to /knowledge
- [ ] Knowledge base loads data (no 401 errors)
- [ ] Check Network tab → API calls have Authorization header
- [ ] Navigate to /settings → loads successfully
- [ ] Navigate to /mcp → loads successfully
- [ ] Click Logout → redirected to /login
- [ ] Try accessing /knowledge directly → redirected to /login
- [ ] Browser console clean (no Vite dev server errors)

## Backend Confirmation

The backend authentication is confirmed working:
- `/api/auth/validate` returns proper auth responses ✓
- `/api/knowledge-items` returns 401 without auth ✓
- API key works: `ak_597A_U6Z6POYpv8Sae-LxSNj2qe5dFXE6qzBjXe0tikQHqkI` ✓

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix** using one of the methods in `DEPLOY_AUTH_FIX.md`
2. **Run verification checklist** to confirm all functionality works
3. **Test with Netzwächter client** to ensure their data is secure
4. **Document** the authentication system for future reference
5. **Consider** adding automated tests for auth flows

## Technical Details

### Build Configuration
- **Bundler**: Vite 5.4.19
- **Build mode**: Production
- **Bundle format**: ES modules
- **Minification**: Enabled
- **Source maps**: Not included in production

### App Architecture
- **Router**: React Router v6
- **Auth Provider**: React Context API
- **Protected Routes**: Higher-order component wrapper
- **API Client**: Configured with auth interceptor
- **Auth Storage**: localStorage

### Auth Implementation
- **Token type**: API Key (Bearer token)
- **Storage key**: `archon_api_key`
- **Validation endpoint**: `/api/auth/validate`
- **Auth header**: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- **Redirect on 401**: Configured in ApiClientConfigurator

## Impact Assessment

### Security Impact
- **High**: Without this fix, the frontend attempts to load protected data
- **Medium**: Backend properly blocks requests, but UX is broken
- **Critical**: Netzwächter data is secure (backend enforces auth)

### User Experience Impact
- **Critical**: Users cannot access the application properly
- **High**: Confusing UI with 401 error alerts
- **High**: No clear indication of how to authenticate

### Business Impact
- **Critical**: Production application non-functional for authenticated workflows
- **High**: Cannot onboard new users (no login page)
- **Medium**: Existing users with cached keys have broken experience

## Conclusion

The frontend authentication system is fully implemented in code but was never deployed to production. The production server is running the Vite development server, which doesn't properly serve the authentication components.

The fix is simple: deploy the production build. This will:
1. Enable proper authentication flow
2. Redirect unauthenticated users to /login
3. Secure all protected routes
4. Provide clean user experience
5. Ensure Netzwächter data remains secure
