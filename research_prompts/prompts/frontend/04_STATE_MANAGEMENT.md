## Objective

Context, Zustand, TanStack Query patterns for React 18+ applications with TypeScript.

6. URL state management
7. State colocation
8. Performance optimization
9. State persistence
10. Testing state management

### Code Examples
- TanStack Query usage
- Zustand store setup
- Context with TypeScript
- State decision examples
- Persisted state with localStorage
