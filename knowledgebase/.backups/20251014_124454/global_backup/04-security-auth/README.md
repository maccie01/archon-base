## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive security and authentication best practices for web application development. These guidelines are framework-agnostic and applicable to any modern web project.

## Navigation

### Core Security Foundations
- [SECURITY_OVERVIEW.md](./SECURITY_OVERVIEW.md) - OWASP Top 10, security principles, threat modeling
- [SECURITY_HEADERS.md](./SECURITY_HEADERS.md) - CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, security headers
- [SECURITY_TESTING.md](./SECURITY_TESTING.md) - Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, audit practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- [AUTHENTICATION_PATTERNS.md](./AUTHENTICATION_PATTERNS.md) - JWT vs sessions vs OAuth2 comparison
- [PASSWORD_SECURITY.md](./PASSWORD_SECURITY.md) - Hashing algorithms, bcrypt, argon2, password policies
- [SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md](./SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md) - Session storage, cookies, expiry, rotation, security
- [JWT_PATTERNS.md](./JWT_PATTERNS.md) - Token structure, validation, refresh tokens, best practices
- [OAUTH2_OPENID.md](./OAUTH2_OPENID.md) - OAuth2 flows, OpenID Connect, provider integration
- [MFA_PATTERNS.md](./MFA_PATTERNS.md) - 2FA, TOTP, SMS, authenticator apps, backup codes
- [AUTHORIZATION_PATTERNS.md](./AUTHORIZATION_PATTERNS.md) - RBAC, ABAC, permissions, policy engines

### Vulnerability Prevention
- [CORS_CONFIGURATION.md](./CORS_CONFIGURATION.md) - CORS policies, preflight, credentials, security
- [CSRF_PROTECTION.md](./CSRF_PROTECTION.md) - CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, double submit pattern
- [XSS_PREVENTION.md](./XSS_PREVENTION.md) - Input sanitization, CSP, output encoding, DOM security
- [SQL_INJECTION_PREVENTION.md](./SQL_INJECTION_PREVENTION.md) - Parameterized queries, ORM safety
- [INPUT_VALIDATION.md](./INPUT_VALIDATION.md) - Validation patterns, sanitization, type safety

### Implementation Practices
- [RATE_LIMITING.md](./RATE_LIMITING.md) - Brute force protection, throttling, backoff strategies
- [API_SECURITY.md](./API_SECURITY.md) - API authentication, versioning, rate limits, validation
- [SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md](./SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md) - Environment variables, vaults, key rotation
- [SSL_TLS.md](./SSL_TLS.md) - HTTPS configuration, certificates, cipher suites, protocols

### Anti-Patterns
- [ANTIPATTERNS.md](./ANTIPATTERNS.md) - Common security mistakes, what NOT to do

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Implement multiple layers of security controls so that if one fails, others provide protection.

### Least Privilege
Grant minimum necessary permissions and access rights to users and systems.

### Fail Securely
Ensure that security failures result in denial of access, not unauthorized access.

### Zero Trust
Never trust, always verify - validate all requests regardless of source.

### Security by Design
Build security into applications from the start, not as an afterthought.

## Quick Reference

### Authentication Methods Comparison

| Method | Use Case | Security Level | Complexity |
|--------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Session-based | Traditional web apps | High | Medium |
| JWT | Stateless APIs, SPAs | Medium-High | Medium |
| OAuth2 | Third-party integration | High | High |
| API Keys | Service-to-service | Medium | Low |

### Password Hashing Recommendations

- **Recommended**: Argon2id (2024 gold standard)
- **Acceptable**: bcrypt (industry standard, proven)
- **Avoid**: SHA-256, MD5, plain text

### Security Headers Priority

1. Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - XSS protection
2. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - Force HTTPS
3. X-Frame-Options - Clickjacking protection
4. X-Content-Type-Options - MIME sniffing protection

## Current Project Analysis

Based on analysis of projects in /Users/janschubert/code-projects/:

### Observed Patterns (netzwaechter-refactored)
- Session-based authentication with express-session
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: user, admin, superadmin
- Session timeout management
- Environment-based superadmin credentials
- PostgreSQL with parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM)

### Security Strengths
- Proper password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with PostgreSQL store (connect-pg-simple)
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Session timeout tracking
- Async error handling with asyncHandler

### Areas for Improvement
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit is installed but implementation not verified)
- Add security headers (helmet middleware)
- Implement MFA for privileged accounts
- Add comprehensive input validation layer
- Consider JWT for API-only endpoints
- Add security logging and monitoring

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Read Overview First**: Start with SECURITY_OVERVIEW.md for foundational concepts
2. **Choose Authentication Method**: Review AUTHENTICATION_PATTERNS.md to select appropriate method
3. **Implement Defenses**: Follow specific guides for each vulnerability type
4. **Test Security**: Use SECURITY_TESTING.md for validation approaches
5. **Avoid Anti-Patterns**: Review ANTIPATTERNS.md before implementation

## Compliance Considerations

These practices align with:
- OWASP Top 10 (2021/2024)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- PCI DSS (for payment systems)
- GDPR (for EU data protection)
- SOC 2 (for service organizations)

## Contributing

When adding new security patterns:
1. Include date and source attribution
2. Provide practical examples with code skeletons
3. List security considerations and trade-offs
4. Reference authoritative sources (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
5. Include both what to do AND what NOT to do

## Disclaimer

Security is a moving target. These guidelines represent best practices as of 2025-10-13. Always:
- Stay updated with latest security advisories
- Conduct regular security audits
- Follow principle of defense in depth
- Test security controls regularly
- Update dependencies promptly
