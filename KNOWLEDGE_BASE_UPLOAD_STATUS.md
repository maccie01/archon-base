# Knowledge Base Upload Status Report

**Date**: 2025-10-14 23:58 UTC
**Server**: netzwaechter (91.98.156.158)
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED - 149/177 files uploaded (84%)

---

## Upload Summary

### Batch Upload Results
- **Total files**: 177 markdown files
- **Successfully uploaded**: 149 files (84%)
- **Failed**: 28 files (16%)
- **Time elapsed**: 534 seconds (~9 minutes)
- **Total size processed**: ~2.79 MB

### Failed Files (28)
All failures occurred in the `projects/netzwaechter_refactored/` section due to HTTP 502 Bad Gateway errors when the server became overwhelmed with concurrent uploads.

**Failed files include:**
- `05-backend/MIDDLEWARE_STACK.md`
- `06-configuration/` directory (7 files)
- `07-standards/` directory (remaining files)
- Final project files in `how-to.md` and README files

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Initial 502 Errors (Resolved)
**Cause**: Too many concurrent uploads overwhelmed the backend
**Impact**: 28 files failed to upload during batches 30-36
**Resolution**: Created retry script with slower pace (3-second delays)

### Issue 2: Ollama Connectivity Lost (CURRENT BLOCKER)
**Cause**: iptables firewall rule disappeared after uploads
**Symptoms**:
- Backend logs: "Health check timeout for http://host.docker.internal:11434"
- Upload endpoint returns: "Failed to create embedding: Request timed out"
- Model discovery: "0 total models, 0 chat, 0 embedding"

**Investigation**:
1. ✅ Ollama service is running: `Active: active (running)`
2. ✅ Ollama listening on all interfaces: `:::11434`
3. ✅ Firewall rule restored: `ACCEPT 6 -- 172.18.0.0/16 tcp dpt:11434`
4. ✅ Direct IP works: `curl http://172.18.0.1:11434` returns 200
5. ❌ `host.docker.internal` not resolving in container
6. ❌ Embedding provider URL in database still uses old URL

**Root Cause**: The embedding provider configuration is stored in the Supabase `archon_credentials` table, not in `.env`. Even though we updated `.env` to use `http://172.18.0.1:11434`, the embedding provider still tries to connect to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

---

## Current Configuration

### Server Configuration
**Ollama Service**:
- Status: Running
- Listening: `:::11434` (all interfaces)
- Models installed: `nomic-embed-text:latest`, `qwen2.5-coder:3b`, `llama3.2:3b`

**Firewall Rules**:
```bash
iptables -L INPUT -n | grep 11434
ACCEPT     6    --  172.18.0.0/16        0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:11434
```

**Docker Network**:
- Network: `supabase_network_archon`
- Gateway: `172.18.0.1`
- Subnet: `172.18.0.0/16`

### Application Configuration
**Environment Variables** (`.env`):
```bash
OLLAMA_URL=http://172.18.0.1:11434  # ✅ Updated
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
```

**Database Configuration** (needs update):
```
Table: archon_credentials
Provider: ollama (embedding)
Base URL: http://host.docker.internal:11434  # ❌ Needs update to 172.18.0.1
Model: nomic-embed-text
```

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE: Update Embedding Provider URL in UI

**You need to**:
1. Open Archon UI: https://archon.nexorithm.io
2. Go to **Settings → AI Providers → Embedding Provider**
3. Change **Base URL** from:
   `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   to:
   `http://172.18.0.1:11434`
4. Click **Test Connection** (should show success with 1 embedding model)
5. **Save** the configuration

### AFTER Settings Update: Retry Failed Uploads

Once the embedding provider URL is updated, run:
```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon
python3 scripts/retry_failed_uploads.py
```

This will retry the 28 failed files with a slower pace (3-second delays) to avoid overwhelming the server.

## Technical Details

### Why host.docker.internal Doesn't Work

The `extra_hosts` configuration in `docker-compose.yml` should map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway`, but this mapping is not working correctly. Possible reasons:

1. **Docker version incompatibility**: Older Docker versions don't support `host-gateway`
2. **Network mode conflict**: Supabase network configuration might interfere
3. **DNS resolution issue**: Container DNS can't resolve the custom host

**Workaround**: Use the direct gateway IP (`172.18.0.1`) instead, which bypasses the DNS resolution and works reliably.

### Test Results

**From Host**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434  # ✅ Works
ollama list  # ✅ Shows 3 models
```

**From Container (direct IP)**:
```python
# docker exec archon-server python -c "..."
urllib.request.urlopen('http://172.18.0.1:11434', timeout=5).status
# ✅ Returns: 200
```

**From Container (host.docker.internal)**:
```python
urllib.request.urlopen('http://host.docker.internal:11434', timeout=5)
# ❌ Raises: TimeoutError: timed out
```

## Next Steps

2. **After update**: Run retry script for 28 failed files
3. **Verify**: Check that all 177 files are successfully indexed
4. **Test**: Perform RAG search queries to validate embeddings
5. **Monitor**: Check Progress → Active Operations for async processing status

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Retry Still Fails After Settings Update

**1. Verify Ollama connectivity from container**:
```bash
ssh root@91.98.156.158 "docker exec archon-server python -c \"import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://172.18.0.1:11434', timeout=5).status)\""
# Expected: 200
```

**2. Check firewall rule is still present**:
```bash
ssh root@91.98.156.158 "iptables -L INPUT -n | grep 11434"
# Expected: ACCEPT rule for 172.18.0.0/16
```

**3. Restart Archon server**:
```bash
ssh root@91.98.156.158 "cd /opt/archon && docker compose restart archon-server"
```

**4. Check model discovery**:
```bash
ssh root@91.98.156.158 "docker logs archon-server 2>&1 | grep 'Discovery complete' | tail -3"
# Expected: "3 total models, 2 chat, 1 embedding"
```

### If Models Not Discovered

Check if the embedding provider configuration in the database was updated:
- The URL should be `http://172.18.0.1:11434`
- The provider should be `ollama`
- The model should be `nomic-embed-text`

You can verify this in Settings UI → AI Providers → Embedding Provider.

## Performance Notes

### Upload Speed
- **Average time per file**: ~3 seconds (including embedding generation)
- **Total batches**: 36 batches of 5 files each
- **Batch delay**: 1 second between batches
- **Failed batch**: Batch 30-36 (server overwhelmed)

### Retry Strategy
- **Files to retry**: 28 files
- **Delay between uploads**: 3 seconds (slower to avoid overwhelming)
- **Expected total time**: ~2 minutes for retries

### Embedding Generation
- **Model**: nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions)
- **Provider**: Ollama (local, no API costs)
- **Performance**: ~2-3 seconds per document (varies by size)

---

## Summary

**Current Status**:
- ✅ 149 files (84%) successfully uploaded and being processed
- ⚠️ 28 files (16%) failed due to server overload
- ❌ Ollama connectivity issue blocking retries

**Blocker**:
Embedding provider URL in database needs to be updated from `host.docker.internal` to `172.18.0.1` via Settings UI.

**Next Action**:
Update embedding provider URL in Settings UI, then run retry script.

**Expected Outcome**:
After settings update and retry, all 177 files should be successfully uploaded and indexed in the knowledge base.
