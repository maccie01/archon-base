## Quick Reference

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight)
- **State**: TanStack Query (server state) + React hooks (UI state)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Lucide React + Heroicons (needs consolidation)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Key Directories
```
apps/frontend-web/src/
├── features/          # Feature modules (11 features)
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── monitoring/
│   ├── energy/
│   ├── users/
│   └── ...
├── components/        # Shared components
│   └── ui/           # shadcn/ui (24 components)
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks (useAuth, useUIMode)
├── lib/              # Utilities (queryClient, utils)
└── styles/           # Global CSS
```

### Two UI Modes
1. **Strawa Mode** (default): Branded layout with tab-based navigation
2. **Cockpit Mode** (`?ui=cockpit`): Full sidebar with traditional routing

### Critical Issues
1. Dialog overlay transparency (global CSS hack)
2. Toast opacity (global CSS hack)
3. Tab styling wars (3 different systems)
4. Table chaos (3 different implementations)
5. No unified design system

---

## For New Developers

### Getting Started
1. Read **FRONTEND_OVERVIEW.md** - Understand architecture
2. Read **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Learn patterns
3. Browse **UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md** - See what's available
4. Check **DESIGN_SYSTEM_CURRENT.md** - Understand styling

### Building a New Feature
1. Create feature directory in `src/features/`
2. Follow structure: api/, components/, hooks/, pages/, types/
3. Use shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui/`
4. Use TanStack Query for data fetching
5. Follow patterns in COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md

### Fixing Bugs
1. Check **UI_INCONSISTENCIES.md** for known issues
2. Check if it's a critical bug (dialogs, toasts)
3. Check if there's a design system violation
4. Fix at component level (avoid global CSS)

---

## For Designers

### Current State
- Two completely different layouts (Strawa vs Cockpit)
- No unified design system
- Multiple color scales (3 gray systems, 5 blues)
- Inconsistent components (tables, tabs, buttons)
- Poor mobile experience

### Design Files
- No Figma file currently exists
- Design tokens documented in DESIGN_SYSTEM_CURRENT.md
- Component screenshots in codebase

### Recommended Reading
1. **DESIGN_SYSTEM_CURRENT.md** - Current implementation
2. **UI_INCONSISTENCIES.md** - What's broken
3. **UI_REDESIGN_NEEDS.md** - Improvement plan

## For Product Managers

### Current UX Problems
1. **Mobile**: Tables unusable, forms difficult
2. **Consistency**: Different UI on every page
3. **Navigation**: Two different sidebars confuse users
4. **Accessibility**: Heading hierarchy issues, contrast problems
5. **Performance**: Large bundle, slow loads on mobile

### Improvement Plan
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (6 phases)
- **Priority**: Critical bugs → Core components → Layout → Polish
- **Approach**: Incremental migration (low risk)
- **Resources**: 1 developer + 1 designer (part-time)

### Success Metrics
- Mobile usability score > 90%
- WCAG AA compliance > 95%
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Bundle size reduced by 20%
- User task completion improved

### Recommended Reading
1. **UI_REDESIGN_NEEDS.md** - Complete improvement plan
2. **UI_INCONSISTENCIES.md** - Current problems

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create component in `features/[feature]/pages/`
2. Add route in `App.tsx`
3. Use Layout or LayoutStrawa
4. Follow patterns in LAYOUT_PATTERNS.md

### Adding a New Component
1. Check if shadcn/ui has it (UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md)
2. If custom, add to `features/[feature]/components/`
3. If shared, add to `components/`
4. Follow patterns in COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md

### Styling a Component
1. Use Tailwind utility classes (primary method)
2. Check design tokens in DESIGN_SYSTEM_CURRENT.md
3. Use shadcn/ui variants when available
4. Avoid inline styles and global CSS

### Fetching Data
1. Create API function in `features/[feature]/api/`
2. Create query hook in `features/[feature]/hooks/`
3. Use TanStack Query patterns from FRONTEND_OVERVIEW.md
4. Handle loading, error, and empty states

## Critical Fixes Needed

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Fix Dialog overlay transparency
2. Fix Toast opacity
3. Remove UserManagement inline styles

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Create unified table component
2. Create unified tab component
3. Consolidate color system

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Mobile-responsive layouts
2. Accessibility fixes
3. Performance optimization

### Long-term (Next 3 Months)
1. Complete design system
2. Component documentation (Storybook)
3. Dark mode support

---

## Key Metrics

### Current State
- **Components**: 24 shadcn/ui + 50+ feature components
- **Features**: 11 feature modules
- **Routes**: 30+ routes (2 layout modes)
- **Global CSS**: 1061 lines (too much)
- **Bundle Size**: ~500KB (unoptimized)

### Codebase Health
- **Good**: Feature-based organization, TypeScript usage, TanStack Query
- **Bad**: Global CSS hacks, inline styles, component duplication
- **Ugly**: Dialog/toast bugs, tab styling wars, table chaos

---

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why two different layouts?
**A**: Historical reasons. Strawa layout for branded experience, Cockpit for advanced users. Should be unified but need product decision.

### Q: Why so many table implementations?
**A**: No unified table component. Each feature built custom. Needs consolidation.

### Q: Why global CSS hacks?
**A**: Quick fixes that became permanent. Should be fixed at component level.

### Q: Can I use dark mode?
**A**: Dark mode styles exist but not tested. Not recommended for production yet.

### Q: Which icon library should I use?
**A**: Currently both Lucide React and Heroicons. Should consolidate to Lucide React only.
