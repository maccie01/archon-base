# ðŸ§­ AI Agent Workflow Knowledge Base â€” Condensed Research Framework

## **Track 1: Task Intelligence & Planning Frameworks**

**Objective:** Build foundational models for *how AI agents understand, plan, and structure work* â€” from decomposition to prioritization and orchestration.

### Core Topics

*   **Autonomous Task Decomposition:** Static vs. dynamic decomposition; hierarchical orchestratorâ€“sub-agent models; optimal task granularity to improve reasoning and minimize hallucinations.
*   **Planning Patterns:** Adaptive workflows for analyzing vague objectives (e.g., bug triage â†’ code isolation â†’ hypothesis â†’ debugging).
*   **Agent Roles & Coordination:** Standard development roles (developer, tester, orchestrator, reviewer, etc.); role-specific prompts and tool restrictions; context inheritance and referral systems for decentralized coordination.
*   **Task Prioritization & Sequencing:** Sequential vs. parallel execution; critical path identification; risk- and value-based prioritization; matching tasks to specialized agent capabilities.
*   **Parallel Work Management:** Centralized, decentralized, hierarchical, and federated orchestration; state management; conflict prevention; synchronization and merge protocols.

### Deliverables

*   Task decomposition templates (static/dynamic YAML/code forms)
*   Orchestration and planning decision trees
*   Standard agent role definitions with access policies
*   Prioritization and scheduling frameworks
*   Conflict resolution & synchronization architectures
