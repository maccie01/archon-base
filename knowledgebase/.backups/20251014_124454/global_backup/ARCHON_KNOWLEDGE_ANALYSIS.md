# Archon Knowledge Base Analysis & Integration Plan

Created: 2025-10-13

Analysis of Archon perplexity research vs. global knowledge base to determine what's critical for developers vs. what Archon handles automatically.

---

## Executive Summary

**Task**: Analyze `/Users/janschubert/tools/archon/perplexity-task-research/` to identify:
1. What's critically important for developer/agent knowledge base
2. What's secondary/redundant because Archon handles it
3. What gaps exist in our current global knowledge base
4. Priority plan for remaining documentation

**Key Finding**: The Archon research covers AI AGENT ORCHESTRATION patterns (how Archon itself works), while our global knowledge base covers SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT patterns (how to build apps). These are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant.

## Archon Research Content Overview

### 4 Research Tracks Analyzed

**Track 1: Task Intelligence & Planning Frameworks**
- How AI agents decompose tasks (DAG structures, static/dynamic decomposition)
- Agent roles & coordination (orchestrator, developer, tester, reviewer, security)
- Task prioritization & sequencing (WSJF, RICE, critical path)
- Parallel work management (centralized, federated, hierarchical orchestration)

**Track 2: Execution, Validation & Quality Control**
- Task completion criteria (schema-based verification, measurable success)
- Testing & QA frameworks (sandbox, regression, failure simulation)
- Workflow patterns (prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, evaluator-optimizer)
- Deployment quality gates

**Track 3: Error Recovery, Debugging & Continuous Optimization**
- Failure detection & recovery (tool misuse, infinite loops, hallucinations)
- Stateful recovery (checkpoints, rollback, COMMIT/BRANCH states)
- Debugging non-deterministic behavior (reasoning trace analysis)
- Monitoring & observability (decision traces, performance metrics)

**Track 4: Knowledge, Memory & Context Management**
- Context architecture (structured repositories: main.md, log.md, commit.md)
- Context retrieval commands (CONTEXT, BRANCH, COMMIT, MERGE)
- Research & information gathering patterns
- Research-to-roadmap conversion

## Critical Analysis: What Goes Where?

### Category 1: ARCHON-SPECIFIC (Let Archon Handle)

**DO NOT add to global knowledge base** - These are Archon's internal orchestration patterns:

1. **Task Decomposition Templates** (YAML/JSON schemas for DAG structures)
   - Why skip: Archon's internal format for task management
   - Developer doesn't need to write DAGs manually
   - Archon handles this automatically

2. **Agent Orchestration Patterns** (centralized, hierarchical, federated)
   - Why skip: Archon's orchestration engine handles this
   - Developers don't configure orchestration topology
   - This is Archon's architecture, not app architecture

3. **Context Retrieval Commands** (CONTEXT, BRANCH, COMMIT, MERGE)
   - Why skip: Archon's MCP commands for context management
   - Developers use these via Archon, don't implement them
   - Already in Archon documentation

4. **Agent Role Definitions** (orchestrator, triager, tester roles with tool access)
   - Why skip: Archon's internal agent types
   - Pre-configured in Archon
   - Not something developers customize per project

5. **Synchronization Architectures** (CRDTs, OT, semantic diffs for agent collaboration)
   - Why skip: Archon's internal conflict resolution
   - Handled automatically by Archon
   - Not developer-facing

### Category 2: HYBRID (Important Concepts for Developers)

**Add ADAPTED versions** - High-level principles that inform how developers work WITH Archon:

1. **Planning Patterns** ✅ IMPORTANT
   - **Why add**: Developers benefit from understanding planning workflows
   - **What to add**: High-level playbooks for common dev tasks
   - **Where**: `/07-development-workflows/` (NEW SECTION NEEDED)
   - **Example**: Bug triage → isolation → hypothesis → fix → validation
   - **Adaptation**: Not Archon's YAML format, but conceptual workflow

2. **Task Prioritization Frameworks** ✅ IMPORTANT
   - **Why add**: Developers need to prioritize work and understand tradeoffs
   - **What to add**: WSJF, RICE, weighted scoring for features/bugs
   - **Where**: `/07-development-workflows/PRIORITIZATION.md` (NEW)
   - **Adaptation**: Remove Archon-specific scheduling, keep general principles

3. **Quality Control Patterns** ✅ IMPORTANT
   - **Why add**: Already partially covered in testing docs, but needs completion gates
   - **What to add**: Completion criteria, validation checkpoints, acceptance testing
   - **Where**: `/05-testing-quality/COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md` (NEW)
   - **Adaptation**: Apply to manual dev process, not just agent validation

4. **Debugging Patterns** ✅ IMPORTANT
   - **Why add**: Currently missing from global knowledge base
   - **What to add**: Systematic debugging workflows, root cause analysis
   - **Where**: `/07-development-workflows/DEBUGGING.md` (NEW)
   - **Adaptation**: Human debugging process, not agent trace analysis

5. **Rollback & Recovery Patterns** ✅ IMPORTANT
   - **Why add**: Production-critical knowledge currently missing
   - **What to add**: Rollback strategies, failure recovery, incident response
   - **Where**: `/02-nodejs-backend/ROLLBACK_STRATEGIES.md` (NEW)
   - **Adaptation**: Application-level rollback, not agent state rollback

### Category 3: NOT APPLICABLE (Archon-Internal Only)

**DO NOT add** - These are purely Archon orchestration internals:

1. **Agent Access Policies** (Rego-like role permissions)
   - Not applicable to application development
   - This is Archon's internal security model

2. **Tool Restrictions** (which agents can use which tools)
   - Archon's internal configuration
   - Not relevant to app development patterns

3. **Context Inheritance Rules** (what context flows between agents)
   - Archon's internal context management
   - Developers don't configure this

4. **Meta-Agent Patterns** (agents that probe for drift, suggest improvements)
   - Advanced Archon feature
   - Not relevant to basic development workflow

## Key Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Archon's Domain:**
- How AI agents orchestrate work
- How Archon manages context and memory
- How Archon decomposes and schedules tasks
- Agent-to-agent coordination

**Developer's Domain:**
- How humans develop software
- Software architecture patterns
- Testing and debugging strategies
- Production deployment patterns

**Our Global Knowledge Base**: Developer's domain only

### 2. Adaptation Strategy

When adapting Archon research patterns:

**Extract**: High-level workflow concepts (bug triage workflow)
**Remove**: Archon-specific implementation (YAML schemas, agent roles)
**Adapt**: Human-centric perspective (developer actions, not agent actions)
**Example**: Code review checklist (keep), Agent reviewer role definition (remove)

### 3. Complementary Documentation

**Archon Documentation**: How to USE Archon (MCP commands, project setup, agent configuration)
**Global Knowledge Base**: How to DEVELOP software (React patterns, Express patterns, testing)
**Project Knowledge Base**: How THIS PROJECT works (Netzwächter API, DB schema, auth)

**All three are needed** and non-redundant.

## Success Metrics

### How to Measure Success

**After Phase 1-2 (4 weeks)**:
- Developers have systematic workflows for bug resolution, feature development
- Production deployments have rollback plans
- Time to resolution for incidents decreases

**After Phase 3-4 (7 weeks)**:
- Feature prioritization uses consistent frameworks
- Technical decisions are documented with ADRs
- Production readiness is checklistable

**After Phase 5-6 (8+ weeks)**:
- All projects use completion criteria
- Observability is standardized
- Performance optimization follows documented workflow

### What NOT to Measure

- How well Archon orchestrates agents (that's Archon's job)
- How agents decompose tasks (Archon handles that)
- Agent coordination efficiency (not developer-facing)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create `07-development-workflows/` directory** ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
2. **Extract workflow patterns from Archon research** (bug resolution, feature dev, code review)
3. **Add rollback strategies to backend docs** ✅ CRITICAL
4. **Remove Archon-specific orchestration details** (keep high-level concepts only)

### Do NOT Do

1. **DO NOT copy Archon orchestration patterns** (let Archon handle this)
2. **DO NOT document agent role definitions** (Archon's domain)
3. **DO NOT add context management commands** (use Archon docs for this)
4. **DO NOT replicate Archon's internal architecture** (unnecessary duplication)

### Next Steps

1. Review this analysis document
2. Confirm priority order (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
3. Decide whether to:
   - Create all P0 docs now (8-12 hours)
   - Create incrementally as needed
   - Use task agents to create skeleton docs
4. Integrate with existing global knowledge base structure
5. Update MASTER_INDEX.md with new sections

## Conclusion

**Key Insight**: Archon research and global knowledge base are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant.

- **Archon**: How AI agents work together
- **Global KB**: How developers build software
- **Both needed**: Developers use KB patterns, Archon orchestrates execution

**What to Add**: Development workflows, rollback strategies, prioritization frameworks, debugging patterns (P0-P1)

**What to Skip**: Agent orchestration, task decomposition schemas, context commands, agent roles (Archon-internal)

**Estimated Work**: 26-38 hours over 8 weeks for complete coverage

**Biggest Gap**: Development workflow patterns (bug resolution, feature dev, code review, incident response)

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 1 (development workflows) - highest immediate value for developers.
