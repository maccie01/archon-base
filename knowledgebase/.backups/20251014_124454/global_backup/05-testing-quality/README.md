Created: 2025-10-13
Last Updated: 2025-10-13

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation on testing strategies, code quality practices, and configuration patterns for modern web applications. These guidelines are framework-agnostic and applicable across projects.

## Documentation Structure

### Testing Strategy and Foundations

- [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - Overall testing approach, pyramid, and philosophy
- [TDD_PATTERNS.md](./TDD_PATTERNS.md) - Test-driven development methodology

### Test Types and Patterns

- [UNIT_TESTING.md](./UNIT_TESTING.md) - Unit test patterns, isolation, and best practices
- [INTEGRATION_TESTING.md](./INTEGRATION_TESTING.md) - Integration test patterns and strategies
- [E2E_TESTING.md](./E2E_TESTING.md) - End-to-end testing with Playwright and Cypress

### Framework-Specific Guides

- [VITEST_PATTERNS.md](./VITEST_PATTERNS.md) - Vitest configuration and patterns
- [REACT_TESTING.md](./REACT_TESTING.md) - React Testing Library best practices
- [BACKEND_TESTING.md](./BACKEND_TESTING.md) - API and backend testing patterns

### Testing Techniques

- [MOCKING_PATTERNS.md](./MOCKING_PATTERNS.md) - Mocking strategies and patterns
- [TEST_COVERAGE.md](./TEST_COVERAGE.md) - Coverage goals and meaningful metrics

### Code Quality

- [CODE_QUALITY.md](./CODE_QUALITY.md) - Static analysis and quality gates
- [ESLINT_CONFIG.md](./ESLINT_CONFIG.md) - ESLint configuration and rules
- [PRETTIER_CONFIG.md](./PRETTIER_CONFIG.md) - Code formatting standards
- [TYPESCRIPT_CONFIG.md](./TYPESCRIPT_CONFIG.md) - TypeScript compiler configuration

## Quick Reference

### Testing Pyramid
- 70% Unit Tests - Fast, isolated, testing single functions/components
- 20% Integration Tests - Testing component interactions
- 10% E2E Tests - Full user flow testing

### Coverage Goals
- Minimum: 75% overall coverage
- Critical paths: 90%+ coverage
- Focus on meaningful coverage over percentage

### Key Principles

1. Write tests that reflect user behavior
2. Test behavior, not implementation
3. Keep tests simple and focused
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
6. Mock external dependencies
7. Maintain test independence

## Getting Started

1. Start with [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for overall philosophy
2. Review framework-specific guides for your stack
3. Implement code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## Additional Resources

See [../06-configuration/](../06-configuration/) for configuration management patterns that complement testing practices.
