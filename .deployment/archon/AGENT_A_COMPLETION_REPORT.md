# Agent A: Docker & Container Security Remediation - Completion Report

Date: 2025-10-15 18:40 UTC
Agent: A (Container Security Specialist)
Server: 91.98.156.158 (netzwaechter)
Status: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY TASKS COMPLETED

---

## Executive Summary

Agent A successfully completed all immediate priority security remediation tasks (A1, A2, A3) and partially completed Task A4. The following security improvements have been implemented:

1. Docker socket access reviewed and secured
2. Restart policies added to all Archon services
3. Archon services and Ollama bound to localhost
4. All changes tested and verified working

---

## Task A1: Audit and Remove Suspicious Docker Socket Access

**Status**: COMPLETED (JUSTIFIED - NO REMOVAL)
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE
**Risk**: CRITICAL

### Investigation Results

The `supabase_vector_archon` container has Docker socket access for a **legitimate purpose**:

- **Service**: Vector (log aggregation tool by Datadog)
- **Purpose**: Collects logs from all Docker containers using the Docker API
- **Socket Mode**: Read-only (`/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`)
- **Function**: Forwards logs to Supabase Analytics for monitoring
- **Security**: Already configured with read-only access (best practice)

### Configuration Verification

```bash
docker inspect supabase_vector_archon | grep docker.sock
# Output: "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
```

Vector configuration shows it monitors Docker containers:
- Source: `docker_logs` type
- Excludes: `supabase_vector_archon` (itself)
- Transforms: Routes logs to appropriate analytics endpoints

### Decision

**SOCKET RETAINED** - This is core Supabase infrastructure functionality. Removing it would break:
- All Supabase service logging
- Analytics dashboard
- Production monitoring
- Debugging capabilities

### Documentation Created

- Justification documented in this report
- Vector configuration reviewed and validated
- Read-only access confirmed as secure

## Task A2: Investigate archon-server Docker Socket Requirement

**Status**: COMPLETED (UPGRADED TO READ-ONLY)
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE
**Risk**: CRITICAL

### Investigation Results

The `archon-server` container uses Docker socket for monitoring the MCP container:

**File**: `/opt/archon/python/src/server/api_routes/mcp_api.py`

**Usage**:
```python
import docker
from docker.errors import NotFound

def get_container_status() -> dict[str, Any]:
    docker_client = docker.from_env()
    container = docker_client.containers.get("archon-mcp")
    # Read container status, uptime, health
```

**API Endpoint**: `/api/mcp/status`
**Operations**: READ-ONLY
- Get container status
- Get container uptime
- Get container health
- No start/stop/management operations

**Dependency**: `docker>=6.1.0` in `pyproject.toml`

### Security Improvement Made

**BEFORE**:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Docker socket for MCP container control
```

**AFTER**:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # Docker socket for MCP container status (read-only)
```

### Verification

Tested read-only socket access:
```bash
docker exec archon-server python -c "import docker; client = docker.from_env(); container = client.containers.get('archon-mcp'); print(f'Container status: {container.status}'); client.close()"
# Output: Container status: running
```

### Backup Created

- File: `docker-compose.yml.backup.readonly_socket.20251015_HHMMSS`
- Location: `/opt/archon/`

---

## Task A3: Add Restart Policies to Archon Services

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE
**Risk**: HIGH

### Services Updated

Added `restart: unless-stopped` to:
1. `archon-server` (FastAPI backend)
2. `archon-mcp` (MCP protocol server)
3. `archon-agents` (AI/ML agents - optional profile)
4. `archon-ui` (Frontend)

### Configuration Changes

```yaml
services:
  archon-server:
    container_name: archon-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    # ... rest of config

  archon-mcp:
    container_name: archon-mcp
    restart: unless-stopped
    # ... rest of config

  archon-ui:
    container_name: archon-ui
    restart: unless-stopped
    # ... rest of config

  archon-agents:
    container_name: archon-agents
    restart: unless-stopped
    # ... rest of config
```

### Verification

```bash
docker inspect archon-server archon-mcp archon-ui --format "{{.Name}}: {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}"
```

**Output**:
```
/archon-server: unless-stopped
/archon-mcp: unless-stopped
/archon-ui: unless-stopped
```

### Benefits

- Services automatically restart after crashes
- Services restart after host reboot
- Improved service availability
- Reduced manual intervention required

## Task A4: Bind Services to 127.0.0.1 Instead of 0.0.0.0

**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**Priority**: SHORT-TERM
**Risk**: CRITICAL

### Services Successfully Bound to Localhost

#### 1. Archon Services (Docker Compose)

**BEFORE**:
```yaml
ports:
  - "${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}:${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}"
  - "${ARCHON_MCP_PORT:-8051}:${ARCHON_MCP_PORT:-8051}"
  - "${ARCHON_UI_PORT:-3737}:3737"
```

**AFTER**:
```yaml
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}:${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}"
  - "127.0.0.1:${ARCHON_MCP_PORT:-8051}:${ARCHON_MCP_PORT:-8051}"
  - "127.0.0.1:${ARCHON_UI_PORT:-3737}:3737"
```

**Verification**:
```bash
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}" | grep archon
```
```
archon-server: 127.0.0.1:8181->8181/tcp
archon-mcp: 127.0.0.1:8051->8051/tcp
archon-ui: 127.0.0.1:3737->3737/tcp
```

#### 2. Ollama Service (Systemd)

**BEFORE** (`/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`):
```
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
```

**AFTER**:
```
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434"
```

**Verification**:
```bash
ss -tlnp | grep :11434
```
```
LISTEN 0 4096 127.0.0.1:11434 0.0.0.0:* users:(("ollama",pid=2029651,fd=3))
```

**Service Restarted**:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart ollama
systemctl status ollama  # Active (running)
```

### Services Requiring Additional Work

#### Supabase Services (Managed by Supabase CLI)

The following Supabase services are still bound to 0.0.0.0:

| Service | Port | Current Binding | Status |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| supabase_kong_archon | 54321 | 0.0.0.0 | Needs binding |
| supabase_db_archon | 54322 | 0.0.0.0 | Needs binding |
| supabase_studio_archon | 54323 | 0.0.0.0 | Needs binding |
| supabase_inbucket_archon | 54324 | 0.0.0.0 | Needs binding |
| supabase_analytics_archon | 54327 | 0.0.0.0 | Needs binding |

**Reason for Incomplete**:
- Supabase services are managed by Supabase CLI, not docker-compose.yml
- Supabase CLI doesn't provide native host binding configuration
- Requires manual container recreation or docker-compose override
- Risk of breaking Supabase stack during modification

**Recommendation**:
- Create a docker-compose override file for Supabase services
- Test in development environment first
- Coordinate with Supabase CLI updates
- OR use iptables rules to restrict access (firewall already in place)

### Security Verification

#### External Access Test (from local machine)
```bash
nc -zv -w 2 91.98.156.158 8181  # Timeout (blocked)
nc -zv -w 2 91.98.156.158 8051  # Timeout (blocked)
nc -zv -w 2 91.98.156.158 3737  # Timeout (blocked)
nc -zv -w 2 91.98.156.158 11434 # Timeout (blocked)
```

#### Localhost Access Test (from server)
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8181/health  # {"status":"healthy"}
curl http://127.0.0.1:8051         # 404 (service running)
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags  # Ollama accessible
```

#### Nginx Proxy Test (public URL)
```bash
curl -I https://archon.nexorithm.io  # HTTP/2 200 (working)
```

### Impact Assessment

**Security Benefits**:
- Archon services no longer exposed to external network
- Ollama no longer exposed to external network
- Services only accessible via Nginx reverse proxy
- Reduced attack surface significantly

**Operational Impact**:
- No disruption to Nginx proxy functionality
- All services still accessible via public URLs
- Localhost access works for debugging
- Firewall remains as defense-in-depth

**Remaining Risk**:
- Supabase services still exposed (mitigated by firewall)
- Recommendation: Complete localhost binding for Supabase services

## Backups Created

All configuration changes have timestamped backups:

```bash
/opt/archon/docker-compose.yml.backup.20251015_HHMMSS  # Initial backup
/opt/archon/docker-compose.yml.backup.readonly_socket.20251015_HHMMSS  # Socket readonly
/opt/archon/docker-compose.yml.backup.localhost_binding.20251015_HHMMSS  # Localhost binding
/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.backup.20251015_HHMMSS  # Ollama config
```

### Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, restore previous configuration:

```bash
cd /opt/archon
docker compose down
cp docker-compose.yml.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d

# For Ollama
cp /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart ollama
```

## Coordination with Agent B

### Verification Required

Agent B should verify that Nginx proxies still function correctly after localhost binding changes:

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# From external network
curl -I https://archon.nexorithm.io      # Should work (200 OK)
curl -I https://arcane.nexorithm.io      # Should work (200 OK)
curl -I https://strawa.cockpit365.pro    # Should work (200 OK)
```

**Expected Nginx Configuration**:
Nginx should be proxying to localhost addresses:
- `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3737;` (archon-ui)
- `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8181;` (archon-server)
- `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:54321;` (supabase kong)

### Status

- Agent A tasks A1, A2, A3 completed
- Agent A task A4 partially completed (Archon + Ollama done, Supabase pending)
- Ready for Agent B coordination
- Nginx proxies verified working

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Tasks

1. **Complete Supabase Localhost Binding** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Research Supabase CLI docker-compose override mechanism
   - Test in development environment
   - Apply to production

2. **Resource Limits** (Task A5 - Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Add CPU and memory limits to all containers
   - Prevent resource exhaustion attacks

3. **Non-Root Users** (Task A6 - Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Run containers as non-root users where possible
   - Reduce privilege escalation risk

4. **Security Scanning** (Tasks A10, A11 - Priority: LOW)
   - Implement automated vulnerability scanning
   - Schedule regular security audits

---

## Files Modified

- `/opt/archon/docker-compose.yml` - Added restart policies, localhost binding, read-only socket
- `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service` - Localhost binding
- Multiple backup files created with timestamps

## Agent A Sign-off

**Status**: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY TASKS COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-10-15 18:40 UTC
**Agent**: A (Docker & Container Security Specialist)

**Summary**: All critical immediate priority tasks (A1, A2, A3) completed successfully. Task A4 partially completed with Archon services and Ollama bound to localhost. Supabase services require additional investigation due to Supabase CLI limitations. All changes tested and verified working. No service disruptions occurred.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Agent B coordination to verify Nginx proxy functionality, then address remaining Supabase localhost binding in subsequent maintenance window.
