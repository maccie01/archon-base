# Knowledge Organization Directory

Created: 2025-10-14

## Purpose

This directory contains meta-documentation and organizational materials for managing the Archon knowledge base. It serves as a central reference for understanding the structure, completion status, and integration processes of the entire knowledge base system.

## Root Files

### SUMMARY.md
Executive summary of the knowledge base organization effort. Contains:
- What was done during organization
- Current completion status (70% overall)
- Quality scores (7.5/10 global, 8.5/10 project)
- Critical gaps identified
- Key discoveries (project standards are complete!)
- Next steps

**Use when**: You need a high-level overview of the entire knowledge base status.

### FILE_MAPPING.md
Detailed mapping of research results to target knowledge base files. Contains:
- Source-to-target file mappings for all domains
- Integration methods (replace, merge, manual)
- Status indicators (ready, needs work, manual)
- File size comparisons (before/after)
- Quick copy commands
- Validation checklists

**Use when**: You're ready to integrate research results into the knowledge base.

### QUICK_START.md
Quick reference guide for getting started with research execution. Contains:
- Where to start based on your goal
- Essential files reference
- Quick research execution workflow
- Current status metrics
- Priority breakdowns
- Quality checklist

**Use when**: You want to jump straight into executing research tasks.

### COMPLETION_TODOS.md
Comprehensive TODO list organized by priority. Contains:
- 26 tasks broken down by priority (P0, P1, P2)
- Detailed requirements for each task
- Effort estimates for each task
- Execution strategy by phase
- Success criteria
- Total remaining work: 84-106 hours

**Use when**: You need detailed requirements for specific tasks or planning work sprints.

## Archive Directory

The `archive/` directory contains historical documentation from completed integration phases. These files provide context about how the knowledge base was organized but are not actively maintained.

### What Belongs in Archive

- Completed integration plans and status reports
- Historical session summaries
- Superseded documentation
- One-time migration/organization materials
- Completed phase documentation

### Archive Files

- **INTEGRATION_PLAN.md**: Original integration strategy
- **INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md**: Final integration completion report
- **INTEGRATION_STATUS.md**: Mid-integration status snapshot
- **INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md**: Integration task checklist
- **RESEARCH_PROMPTS_COMPLETE.md**: Research prompt creation completion
- **INTEGRATION_README.md**: Integration process documentation
- **SESSION_COMPLETE.md**: Session-specific completion summary
- **INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md**: Overall integration summary

**Use when**: You need historical context about how the knowledge base was organized.

## Scripts Directory

The `scripts/` directory contains automation utilities for knowledge base management.

### integrate.sh

Automated integration script for copying research results into the knowledge base.

**Features**:
- Creates backups before integration
- Integrates security domain files (14 files)
- Integrates testing domain files (3 files)
- Validates integration (checks for HTML artifacts, unclosed code blocks)
- Generates integration report

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/knowledgebase/knowledge-organization/scripts
./integrate.sh
```

**Note**: Frontend and database domains require manual integration due to existing content.

### cleanup_html.py

Python utility for removing HTML wrapper tags from Perplexity-generated markdown files.

**Features**:
- Removes `<pre>`, `<div>`, `<button>`, `<span>` tags
- Preserves markdown and code blocks
- Cleans up excessive blank lines
- Reports reduction statistics

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /Users/janschubert/tools/archon/knowledgebase/knowledge-organization/scripts
python3 cleanup_html.py
```

**Processes**:
- Database domain files (3 files)
- Frontend domain files (4 files)

## When to Add New Files

### Add to Root (knowledge-organization/)

Add new files here when they:
- Provide meta-documentation about the knowledge base
- Track organization or integration progress
- Serve as reference guides for the entire knowledge base
- Are actively maintained and referenced

**Examples**: Status reports, progress trackers, integration guides

### Add to Archive

Move files to archive when they:
- Document completed phases or migrations
- Are superseded by newer documentation
- Provide historical context but are no longer actively used
- Are one-time organizational materials

**Examples**: Completed integration plans, historical status reports

### Add to Scripts

Add scripts when they:
- Automate knowledge base management tasks
- Perform file operations (copying, cleaning, validating)
- Generate reports or statistics
- Are reusable utilities

**Examples**: Integration scripts, cleanup utilities, validation tools

## Navigation Guide
